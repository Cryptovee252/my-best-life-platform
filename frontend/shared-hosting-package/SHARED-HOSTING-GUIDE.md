# 🚀 My Best Life - Shared Hosting Deployment Guide

## 🎯 Overview

This guide is specifically designed for **shared hosting** accounts (like Hostinger shared hosting) that don't support Node.js applications. We've converted the backend to PHP, which is fully supported on all shared hosting plans.

## ✨ What's Different from Node.js Version

- ✅ **Backend**: PHP instead of Node.js
- ✅ **Database**: MySQL instead of PostgreSQL
- ✅ **Email**: PHPMailer instead of Nodemailer
- ✅ **No SSH required**: Everything done through File Manager
- ✅ **No command line**: All setup through Hostinger control panel

## 📋 Prerequisites

- ✅ Hostinger shared hosting account
- ✅ Domain connected to hosting (mybestlifeapp.com)
- ✅ Gmail account for sending emails
- ✅ Basic knowledge of using Hostinger control panel
