# ðŸš€ HelpMyBestLife - Hostinger Deployment Guide

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

Before deploying, make sure you have:
- âœ… A Hostinger hosting account
- âœ… Your domain name configured
- âœ… Access to Hostinger's File Manager or FTP
- âœ… The `hostinger-deploy` folder ready (already created)

## ðŸŽ¯ Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Access Your Hostinger Account

1. **Login to Hostinger**
   - Go to [hostinger.com](https://hostinger.com)
   - Click "Login" and enter your credentials
   - Access your hosting control panel

2. **Navigate to File Manager**
   - In your Hostinger dashboard, find "File Manager"
   - Click to open the File Manager

### Step 2: Navigate to Website Root

1. **Open Public HTML**
   - In File Manager, navigate to `public_html` folder
   - This is your website's root directory
   - **Important**: Make sure you're in the correct domain's `public_html` folder

### Step 3: Upload Files

1. **Upload All Files**
   - Select ALL contents from the `hostinger-deploy` folder
   - Upload them to `public_html`
   - **Maintain folder structure** - don't change any folder names
   - Include all subdirectories (`_expo`, `assets`, `group`, `(tabs)`, etc.)

2. **File Structure After Upload**
   ```
   public_html/
   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html              # Main landing page
   â”œâ”€â”€ login.html              # Login page
   â”œâ”€â”€ register.html           # Registration page
   â”œâ”€â”€ mind.html               # Mind category
   â”œâ”€â”€ body.html               # Body category
   â”œâ”€â”€ soul.html               # Soul category
   â”œâ”€â”€ stories.html            # Stories page
   â”œâ”€â”€ profile.html            # Profile page
   â”œâ”€â”€ settings.html           # Settings page
   â”œâ”€â”€ notifications.html      # Notifications page
   â”œâ”€â”€ modal.html              # Modal pages
   â”œâ”€â”€ two.html                # Additional pages
   â”œâ”€â”€ +not-found.html         # 404 page
   â”œâ”€â”€ _sitemap.html           # Sitemap
   â”œâ”€â”€ favicon.ico             # App icon
   â”œâ”€â”€ metadata.json           # App metadata
   â”œâ”€â”€ _expo/                  # Expo framework files
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ static/
   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ js/
   â”‚           â””â”€â”€ web/
   â”‚               â””â”€â”€ entry-*.js
   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/                 # App assets
   â”œâ”€â”€ group/                  # Group pages
   â””â”€â”€ (tabs)/                 # Tab navigation pages
   ```

### Step 4: Configure Domain Settings

1. **Set Default Page**
   - Ensure `index.html` is set as the default page
   - This should be automatic, but verify in Hostinger settings

2. **Enable HTTPS**
   - In Hostinger control panel, go to "SSL"
   - Enable SSL certificate for your domain
   - This ensures secure connections

3. **Configure URL Rewriting**
   - Create a `.htaccess` file in `public_html` (if not already present)
   - Add the following content:

```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /

# Handle React Router
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.html [L]

# Enable Gzip compression
<IfModule mod_deflate.c>
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/plain
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/xml
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/css
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/xml
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/xhtml+xml
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/rss+xml
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/javascript
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/x-javascript
</IfModule>

# Set cache headers
<IfModule mod_expires.c>
    ExpiresActive on
    ExpiresByType text/css "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType application/javascript "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/png "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/jpg "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/jpeg "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/gif "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/ico "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/icon "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType text/plain "access plus 1 month"
    ExpiresByType application/x-shockwave-flash "access plus 1 month"
    ExpiresByType text/html "access plus 1 hour"
</IfModule>

# Security headers
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
    Header always set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff
    Header always set X-Frame-Options DENY
    Header always set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"
    Header always set Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
</IfModule>
```

### Step 5: Test Your Website

1. **Visit Your Domain**
   - Go to `https://yourdomain.com`
   - The app should load and be fully functional

2. **Test Key Features**
   - âœ… Landing page loads correctly
   - âœ… Registration and login work
   - âœ… Dashboard displays properly
   - âœ… Stories can be added and persist
   - âœ… Tasks can be completed
   - âœ… Navigation works smoothly
   - âœ… All pages load without errors

### Step 6: Performance Optimization

1. **Enable Gzip Compression**
   - In Hostinger control panel, enable Gzip compression
   - This reduces file sizes by 60-80%

2. **Use CDN** (Optional)
   - Consider using Hostinger's CDN for better global performance
   - This improves loading speed for users worldwide

3. **Monitor Performance**
   - Use Google PageSpeed Insights to check performance
   - Monitor loading times and user experience

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **404 Errors**
   - Ensure all files are uploaded to the correct directory
   - Check that `index.html` is in the root of `public_html`
   - Verify `.htaccess` file is present and correct

2. **JavaScript Errors**
   - Check browser console for specific errors
   - Verify all `_expo` files are uploaded
   - Clear browser cache and try again

3. **Styling Issues**
   - Ensure CSS files are properly uploaded
   - Check for missing assets
   - Verify responsive design is working

4. **Routing Issues**
   - Confirm `.htaccess` is working
   - Test direct URL access
   - Check Hostinger URL rewriting settings

### Performance Issues

1. **Slow Loading**
   - Enable Gzip compression
   - Use CDN if available
   - Optimize images
   - Check server response times

2. **Mobile Issues**
   - Test on different devices
   - Check responsive design
   - Verify touch interactions
