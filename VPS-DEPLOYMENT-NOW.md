# 🚀 **DEPLOY TO VPS NOW - Version 1.2**

## **Your VPS Landing Page Still Shows Old Version Because:**

❌ **We only deployed to GitHub, not to your VPS yet**  
❌ **Your VPS is still running the old version**  
✅ **Version 1.2 with enterprise security is ready to deploy**

---

## **🚀 QUICK VPS DEPLOYMENT**

### **Step 1: Provide Your VPS Details**

I need these details to deploy:

```bash
# Your VPS IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
VPS_IP="your.vps.ip.address"

# Your VPS username (e.g., root, ubuntu, admin)
VPS_USER="your_username"

# Your domain (e.g., mybestlifeapp.com)
VPS_DOMAIN="mybestlifeapp.com"
```

### **Step 2: Run Deployment Script**

```bash
# Option 1: Set environment variables
export VPS_IP="your.vps.ip.address"
export VPS_USER="your_username" 
export VPS_DOMAIN="mybestlifeapp.com"
./deploy-to-vps.sh

# Option 2: Run with parameters
./deploy-to-vps.sh your.vps.ip.address your_username mybestlifeapp.com
```

### **Step 3: Upload to VPS**

The script will create: `helpmybestlife-v1.2-vps-deployment.tar.gz`

```bash
# Upload to your VPS
scp helpmybestlife-v1.2-vps-deployment.tar.gz your_username@your.vps.ip.address:/home/your_username/

# SSH into your VPS
ssh your_username@your.vps.ip.address

# Extract and deploy
tar -xzf helpmybestlife-v1.2-vps-deployment.tar.gz
cd vps-deployment
./setup-vps.sh
./deploy-app.sh
```
